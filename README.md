# MCQ Website

This is a full stack project consisting of developing the front and back end of a school MCQ website.
You may see 'QCM' instead of MCQ sometimes, well, excuse my french.

The documentation of the API can be found [here](https://nelson888.github.io/qcm-app/api/index.html)


## Users
There is two kinds of users:

### The Teacher
The teacher, who can create/update/delete MCQs, launch them, terminate them, and see the results of the one finished

### The Student
He/She can answer a MCQ, and then see (only) his/her own results
